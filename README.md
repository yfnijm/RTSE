# RTSE
## Basic Information
R-tree is a girdless data structure base on B-tree to speed up searches in space, *R* is stand for *Rectangle*. The average search time would be O(lg(n)) and n is the object number.

## Problem to solve
To speed up the operation between target(box, segement , point) and the space, using the C++ code to implement the core function.

To solve the most of EDA problem which only have a few layer, this project would focus on providing the 2D R-tree related API. And it would be usful to the placement and routing problem especially.


## Perspective users
The student of EDA related Lab.
And anyone need to speed up the area search in their works.

## System architecture
The system base on the main data structure class **R-tree** and users can add or delete new object and dynamically modify the data inside. And users also can query the imformation they what in the stucture at all times.

## API description
Currenet API phototype are refer to:
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/index.html

the basic API:

:::info

model(): initial the R-tree data

insert(obj): add object into the R-tree

remove(obj): delete object from the R-tree

intersects(box): search the objects intersect with the box

covered_by(box): search the objects covered by the box

## Engineering infrastructure
- Language: C++, Python3 (Pytest for testing)
- Bulid system: GNU make
- Version control: git

| Date | Target                                                                                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4/4  | Built the API and implement the data structure and function in naive way.                                          |
| 4/11 | Implement the basic R-tree.                                                                                        |
| 4/18 | Add advanced funciton (segement, point search or related operation) if privious week target finished successfully. |
| 4/25 | Provide the API of Python3 and run the unit test.                                                                  |
| 5/2  | Generate more testcase and compare to previous related work (k-d tree, and naive structure).                       |
| 5/9  | Visualize the testcase and tried different heuristic function to generate R-tree.                                  |
| 5/16 | Compare to other's R/R+/R*-tree. And implement my privious EDA project with the project.                           |
| 5/23 | Prepare the presentation .                                                                                         |
